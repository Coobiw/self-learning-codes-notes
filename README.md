# Repo for storing the codes and notes when I learn DL,CV,NLP

Please keep fighting!

## pytorch codes

- various classification model (evaluated on CIFAR-10)
- semantic segmentation and visualization(stacked in Seg_Predictor class) (evaluated on VOC2012-Seg)
- Word2Vec & GloVe
- Rumer Detection(use BoW/LSTM/Word2Vec&MLP/BERT) (BERT get 95% acc on val set and 92% acc on test set) (Dataset: CED Dataset which is proposed by Tsinghua Group)

## notes

- Backbone/Module
- Object Detection
- Semantic Segmentation
- Image Caption
- Self Supervised Learning
